⦁ A computer is an electronic device capable of performing arithmetic and logical operations
⦁ A computer system has two components: hardware and software
⦁ The central processing unit (CPU) and the main memory are examples of hardware components
⦁ All programs must be brought into main memory before they can be executed
⦁ When the power is switched off, everything in main memory is lost
⦁ Secondary storage provides permanent storage for information. Hard disks, flash drives, and CD-ROMs are examples of secondary storage
⦁ Input to the computer is done via an input device. Two common input devices are the keyboard and the mouse
⦁ The computer sends its output to an output device, such as the computer screen or a printer
⦁ Software are programs run by the computer
⦁ The operating system handles the overall activity of the computer and provides services
⦁ The most basic language of a computer is a sequence of 0s and 1s called machine language. Every computer directly understands its own machine language.
⦁  A bit is a binary digit, 0 or 1
⦁  A byte is a sequence of eight bits
⦁  A sequence of 0s or 1s is referred to as a binary code or a binary number
⦁  Assembly language uses easy-to-remember instructions called mnemonics
⦁  Assemblers are programs that translate a program written in assembly language into machine language
⦁  Compilers are programs that translate a program written in a high-level language into machine code, called object code
⦁  A linker links the object code with other programs provided by the integrated development environment (IDE) and used in the program to produce executable code
⦁  Typically, six steps are needed to execute a C++ program: edit, preprocess, compile, link, load, and execute
⦁  A loader transfers executable code into main memory
⦁  An algorithm is a step-by-step problem-solving process in which a solution is arrived at in a finite amount of time
⦁  The problem-solving process has three steps: analyze the problem and design an algorithm, implement the algorithm in a programming language, and maintain the program
⦁  In structured design, a problem is divided into smaller subproblems. Each subproblem is solved, and the solutions to all of the subproblems are then combined to solve the problem
⦁  In object-oriented design (OOD), a program is a collection of interacting objects
⦁  An object consists of data and operations on that data
⦁  The ANSI/ISO Standard C++ syntax was approved in mid-1998
⦁  The second standard of C++, C++11, was approved in 2011
