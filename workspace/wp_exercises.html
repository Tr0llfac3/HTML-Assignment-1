    d. Information stored in secondary storage is permanent
    e. The language of a computer is a sequence of 0s and 1s
    f. In Unicode every character is coded as a sequence of 16 bits
    g. ZB stands for zero byte
    h. A program written in a high-level programming language is called a source program
